Javascript notes

In JS can interact with the page without needing to reload

AJAX - (Look this up)
  - A request allows a user to submit a request to a website asynchronously

Node was developed in order to allow JS to be used on the backend

ECMAScript 6 is the newest version of javascript

Object is the javascript equivalent of a hash
Object.keys - This has support across all major browsers
Object.values is more experimental

function NBAplayer (name, team, pos) {
  this.name = name;
  this.team = team;
  this.pos = pos;
}


- This is a constructor function - it will define what an NBA player will look like

const curry = new NBAPlayer (

Every function in JS will have a prototype defined on it
NBAPlayer.prototype.dunk = function(){}
  - This is equivalent to creating a method for a JS class

curry__proto__ == NBAPlayer.prototype

let curry = new NBAPlayer("Steph Curry", "", "");
NBAPlayer.prototype.dunk = console.log(`${this.name} dunks!`)

Can change the values by just going curry.name = "Steph"

nested functions
setting a variable through let something = something

a closure is capturing a variable that was defined at the time that the over function was defined

new value from inside the closure persists outside it
 -- The scope is different from the ruby scope
 --Callback - A function that is passed into another function. This is only executed when the user clicks the button, etc.

Defining global variables is not  good practice

Functions within functions
